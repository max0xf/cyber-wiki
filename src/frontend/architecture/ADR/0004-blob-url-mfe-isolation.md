**ID**: `cpt-hai3-adr-blob-url-mfe-isolation`
## Context and Problem Statement

Browsers cache ES modules by URL identity — when multiple MFEs share dependencies via Module Federation's shareScope, they receive the same module instance. This breaks per-MFE isolation: module-level state such as each MFE's EventBus instance and Redux store is shared rather than scoped. The previous approach using Module Federation's singleton/shared mechanism could not achieve true per-runtime isolation because it was designed to prevent duplicate instances, not to guarantee separate ones.

## Decision Drivers

* Each MFE load must produce its own module-level state instances (EventBus, store, i18n) regardless of caching
* The solution must not introduce `@hai3/*` dependencies into L1 packages (zero-dependency constraint)
* Blob URLs must never be revoked — `import()` resolves at parse time, not evaluation time, so early revocation causes load failures with top-level await

## Considered Options

* Fetch source text and create a unique Blob URL per MFE load via `URL.createObjectURL`
* Module Federation singleton/shared mechanism
* Service Worker URL interception
* `Function()` re-evaluation of module source
* Import maps with per-MFE scope overrides

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Fetch source text and create a unique Blob URL per MFE load via `URL.createObjectURL`", because Blob URLs are unique by construction (`blob:<origin>/<uuid>`), forcing fresh module evaluation with its own module-level state per the ES module spec. Simple string replacement for import specifier rewriting respects the L1 zero-dependency constraint without introducing a parser dependency.

### Consequences

* Good, because each MFE load has true module-level isolation — EventBus instances, stores, and singletons are independent regardless of the number of MFEs loaded simultaneously
* Bad, because blob URLs accumulate (~30–40 per load) and source text is cached in memory; the `hai3-mfe-externalize` Vite plugin adds build-time complexity for MFE authors

### Confirmation

`packages/screensets/src/mfe/blobLoader.ts` implements blob URL creation and import specifier rewriting. `packages/screensets/src/mfe/sourceCache.ts` caches fetched source text. The `hai3-mfe-externalize` Vite plugin is configured in MFE build configs to ensure all shared dependency imports use `importShared()` across the entire bundle. Host share-scope bootstrap code has been removed.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Fetch source text and create a unique Blob URL per MFE load

* Good, because the UUID embedded in every blob URL guarantees no two loads share a module instance, and no browser or bundler workaround is required
* Bad, because memory usage grows proportionally with the number of loaded MFEs and the size of their shared dependency graph

### Module Federation singleton/shared mechanism

* Good, because it is the built-in Module Federation solution with wide community documentation
* Bad, because singleton sharing is designed to prevent duplicate instances — it cannot produce isolated instances per MFE load by design

### Service Worker URL interception

* Good, because interception is transparent to the MFE bundle and requires no build-time changes
* Bad, because Module Federation's runtime never makes network requests for shared modules after the first load, so Service Worker interception has no opportunity to act

### `Function()` re-evaluation of module source

* Good, because `new Function(source)()` always produces a fresh evaluation
* Bad, because `Function()` does not support ES module syntax (`import`/`export`), making it incompatible with ESM-first packages

### Import maps with per-MFE scope overrides

* Good, because import maps are a web standard with clean URL remapping semantics
* Bad, because import maps are static after the first `<script type="importmap">` is parsed — dynamically adding per-MFE scopes at runtime is not supported

## More Information

- The never-revoke rule: `URL.createObjectURL` returns a URL that persists until explicitly revoked. Because `import()` with top-level await may parse (and cache the URL reference) before the module body executes, revoking the blob URL before all dependent modules finish loading causes `ERR_FAILED` on subsequent imports of the same specifier
- The `hai3-mfe-externalize` Vite plugin rewrites all `import { X } from '@hai3/...'` statements in MFE bundles to `const { X } = await importShared('@hai3/...')`, which is then intercepted by the blob loader to inject per-load instances

- Related: ADR 0002 (Event-Driven Flux Data Flow) — EventBus isolation is the primary motivation for per-MFE module scope

This decision directly addresses:
* `cpt-hai3-fr-blob-fresh-eval` — fresh evaluation via unique blob URL per load
* `cpt-hai3-fr-blob-no-revoke` — prohibition on revoking blob URLs after import
* `cpt-hai3-fr-blob-source-cache` — source text caching strategy
* `cpt-hai3-fr-blob-import-rewriting` — string-based import specifier rewriting
* `cpt-hai3-fr-blob-recursive-chain` — recursive resolution of transitive shared dependencies
* `cpt-hai3-fr-blob-per-load-map` — per-load blob URL map preventing duplicate fetches within a single load
* `cpt-hai3-fr-externalize-transform` — build-time Vite plugin transforming MFE shared imports
* `cpt-hai3-nfr-perf-blob-overhead` — accepted performance cost of blob URL accumulation
