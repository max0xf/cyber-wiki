**ID**: `cpt-hai3-adr-react-19-ref-as-prop`
## Context and Problem Statement

React 19 introduces ref as a regular prop, deprecating `forwardRef`. App-owned UI components may have `forwardRef` declarations that need updating. A big-bang migration risks a high failure rate and difficult rollback. The upgrade also brings other breaking changes: string refs removed and implicit children type changes.

## Decision Drivers

* Reduce risk by separating dependency risk from refactoring risk
* Eliminate deprecated `forwardRef` usage to adopt modern React 19 patterns
* Maintain rollback capability at each migration phase
* Keep human error low across 100 `forwardRef` declarations

## Considered Options

* Two-phase staged migration using official codemod
* Big-bang migration (upgrade and refactor simultaneously)
* Manual migration of all `forwardRef` declarations
* Keep `forwardRef` indefinitely

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Two-phase staged migration using official codemod", because separating dependency risk from refactoring risk makes each phase independently verifiable and rollback-capable. React 19 maintains backward compatibility with `forwardRef` during Phase 1, enabling faster rollback if issues arise. The official codemod reduces human error across 100 declarations.

### Consequences

* Good, because modern React patterns are adopted, component signatures are simpler, and the codebase is future-proof
* Bad, because two phases of effort are required and the codemod may miss edge cases — one manual fix is needed for `textarea.tsx` where `useImperativeHandle` is used

### Confirmation

All app-owned UI components accept ref as a prop without a `forwardRef` wrapper. React 19 is declared as a peer dependency in `packages/react/package.json`.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Two-phase staged migration using official codemod

* Good, because each phase is independently verifiable and rollback boundaries are clear
* Good, because the official codemod reduces human error across 100 declarations
* Bad, because `useImperativeHandle` edge cases require manual handling after codemod runs

### Big-bang migration

* Good, because it completes the upgrade in a single effort
* Bad, because simultaneous dependency risk and refactoring risk make rollback difficult and the failure surface is large

### Manual migration of all forwardRef declarations

* Good, because each component can be reviewed individually during migration
* Bad, because migrating 100 declarations by hand is time-consuming and error-prone

### Keep forwardRef indefinitely

* Good, because no migration effort is required
* Bad, because `forwardRef` is deprecated in React 19 and blocks adoption of new React patterns

This decision directly addresses:

* `cpt-hai3-nfr-compat-react` — React 19 compatibility requirement
* `cpt-hai3-component-react` — React package peer dependency declarations
