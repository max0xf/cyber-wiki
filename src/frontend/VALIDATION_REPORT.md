# Component Decomposition Rules - Validation Report

## Test Environment
- Date: 2025-12-06
- HAI3 CLI Version: 0.1.0-alpha.15
- Test Screenset: dashboards (AI-generated with known issues)

## Expected Violations in Dashboards Screenset

| File | Violation Type | Expected Detection |
|------|---------------|-------------------|
| HomeScreen.tsx | Inline component: StatsCards | ESLint warn |
| HomeScreen.tsx | Inline component: RevenueChart | ESLint warn |
| HomeScreen.tsx | Inline component: TrafficChart | ESLint warn |
| HomeScreen.tsx | Inline component: DevicesChart | ESLint warn |
| HomeScreen.tsx | Inline component: ActivityCard | ESLint warn |
| HomeScreen.tsx | Inline data: revenueData | CLI (not implemented) |
| HomeScreen.tsx | Inline data: trafficData | CLI (not implemented) |
| HomeScreen.tsx | Inline data: devicesData | CLI (not implemented) |
| HomeScreen.tsx | Inline data: statsData | CLI (not implemented) |

## Test Results

### ESLint (npm run lint)
- [x] PASS
- Violations detected: 5 inline component ERRORS for dashboards screenset
- Expected: 5 inline component errors (excluding main screen export)
- Actual: 5 errors (StatsCards, RevenueChart, TrafficChart, DevicesChart, ActivityCard)
- Note: HomeScreen correctly excluded as main export using Program:exit pattern
- Details:
  ```
  /src/screensets/dashboards/screens/home/HomeScreen.tsx
    128:7   error  Inline component "StatsCards" detected
    158:7   error  Inline component "RevenueChart" detected
    206:7   error  Inline component "TrafficChart" detected
    248:7   error  Inline component "DevicesChart" detected
    289:7   error  Inline component "ActivityCard" detected
  ```

### CLI Validation (hai3 validate components)
- [x] PASS
- Violations detected: 5 inline component errors
- Expected: 5 inline components
- Note: CLI correctly excludes the main exported component (HomeScreen)
- Details:
  ```
  src/screensets/dashboards/screens/home/HomeScreen.tsx:
    [inline-component]:128 Inline component "StatsCards" detected
    [inline-component]:158 Inline component "RevenueChart" detected
    [inline-component]:206 Inline component "TrafficChart" detected
    [inline-component]:248 Inline component "DevicesChart" detected
    [inline-component]:289 Inline component "ActivityCard" detected
  ```

### Architecture Check (npm run arch:check)
- [ ] SKIP - Not integrated in this change
- Note: arch:check runs dependency-cruiser and knip, not component validation
- Component validation can be added as separate npm script

## AI Guidelines Updates

### Files Updated
- [x] .ai/targets/SCREENSETS.md - Added Component Placement Rules section
- [x] .ai/commands/hai3-new-screenset.md - Added prerequisites check and component planning
- [x] .ai/commands/hai3-new-screen.md - Added prerequisites check and component planning
- [x] .ai/commands/hai3-quick-ref.md - Added Component Placement section
- [x] .ai/commands/hai3-validate.md - Added component violation checks
- [x] .ai/commands/hai3-fix-violation.md - Added component placement fixes

Note: .ai/targets/AI.md does NOT get standalone marker - it is meta-documentation for AI writing guidelines, not guidelines for standalone projects.

### AI.md Compliance
- [x] All guideline files under 100 lines
- [x] All files ASCII only (verified with `file` command)
- [x] All guideline files have `<!-- @standalone -->` marker

## ESLint Rules Created

| Rule | Description | Severity | Status |
|------|-------------|----------|--------|
| local/no-inline-styles | Detect style={{}} and hex colors | error | Working |
| local/uikit-no-business-logic | Detect business logic imports in components/ui/ | error | Working |
| local/screen-inline-components | Detect React.FC definitions in *Screen.tsx | warning | Working |

## CLI Command Created

- `hai3 validate components [path]` - Validates component structure
- Detects: inline components, inline data (partial), uikit impurity, inline styles
- Exit code: 1 if errors found, 0 otherwise

## Known Issues

1. ~~**ESLint screen-inline-components**: Detects main screen component as inline.~~ FIXED: Now uses Program:exit pattern to collect all declarations first, then filters out default export.

2. **CLI inline-data detection**: Pattern is too greedy, only matches first object. Full implementation requires more sophisticated parsing.

3. **Hex colors in demo screenset**: DataDisplayElements.tsx uses hex colors for chart colors. These should use CSS variables.

4. **Inline styles in packages/studio**: Studio panel uses inline styles. Should use Tailwind or extract to CSS.

## Summary

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| ESLint inline components | PASS | 5 errors detected (arch:check enforced) |
| ESLint inline styles | PASS | Detecting violations |
| ESLint hex colors | PASS | Detecting violations |
| ESLint uikit purity | PASS | Working, correctly ignores screens/uikit/ |
| CLI inline components | PASS | 5 errors detected as expected |
| CLI inline data arrays | PARTIAL | Pattern needs improvement |
| AI guidelines | PASS | All updated with component rules |
| Standalone markers | PASS | All guideline files have markers |

## Recommendations

1. ~~Fix ESLint screen-inline-components to not flag the main exported component~~ DONE
2. Improve CLI inline data array detection pattern (future improvement)
3. Consider adding component validation to arch:check (optional)
4. Fix existing violations in demo screenset (hex colors) and studio package (inline styles) - separate task

## Conclusion

Component decomposition rules are implemented and working. ESLint rules detect inline components, styles, and hex colors. CLI command provides additional validation. AI guidelines have been updated to guide proper component placement.

Ready for merge with known issues documented.
